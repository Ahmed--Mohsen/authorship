When Rupert Murdoch decreed his Fox television network must turn over an hour of its primest time - between eight and nine in the evening - to unadulterated Bush and Gore, just 2.9 million Americans tuned in. An all-time low, a fiasco. There will probably be an actual turn-out to match on Tuesday. This undynamic duo (as Willie Whitelaw would say) are touring the country trying, pretty successfully, to stir up apathy. But consider: one day, the face of the victor will be chiselled from Mount Rushmore. One day his picture will hang in national galleries and his shrine of a memorial library will draw visitors to Austin or Nashville. Presidents of the United States aren't only politicians who managed to get elected; they become monarchs, gods and legends. It is the great dislocation of the race. While the watching millions weren't switching to Fox, five times that number were watching Martin Sheen play at being President in NBC's  West Wing . The drama and the romance of the job still command an audience.  But what, precisely, is the job? Stanley O. Jones, a professor of politics at the University of Wisconsin, asked a few questions of the freshman class at Beloit College there. They couldn't (among other things) remember Reagan; they had no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran; they had never seen black-and-white TV; they knew only one Pope - and only one President. For young voters - the most turned-off of the lot - the once and continuing Commander-in-Chief is a man called Clinton and the job is what he's made of it.  Jones is making a crucial point in a new collection of essays called  The Permanent Campaign and its Future . Once, presidents stood for election. Now they run for election, and Clinton is the great runner. He's been running all his adult life and that life begins to draw to a premature close when there is nowhere else for him to run. Thus the running defines the role.  Are Gore and Bush similarly fleet of foot and silvery of tongue? No, they're both comparative plodders. How, then, will they survive in the Oval Office? With lumpen difficulty.  The calibre of the contenders, in reality, does not shrink. Is Gore a duffer candidate than Dukakis? Is Bush more intellectually challenged than Gerald Ford? (In fact, if elected, he and Herbert Hoover will tie as the most highly educated presidents in the last eight decades.) What the presidency does do is alter in its demands, a chameleon of elective office.  There's no Cold War any longer, so the military dimension is gone and, with it, the awed deference due to the supreme general. Soon, no would-be president will ever have had a realistic chance of putting on a combat uniform. Even now, a few months in fatigues reporting from Vietnam or flying jets for the Texas national guard seems to do duty as the red badge of courage.  Meanwhile, the need to raise funds has spiralled beyond previous imagining. Bush has spent $187 million this year. That lowering mountain of need has to be thought of and climbed every month of every year.  But perhaps the most profound difference of all is in the parties behind the present pair. They are smaller than they were, diminished bands of activists trading insults across the bowed heads of tens of millions of independents; but diminution also makes those who remain more committed, more ornery, less willing to compromise.  The zealotry of the House of Representatives' Newt Gingrich helped fashion is no accident, nor its ruthless pursuit of Clinton's impeachment. When Bush promises kinder, gentler times inside the beltway, he doesn't say how he will change his own visceral warriors there like Tom Delay, the majority whip.  We reach election day, of course, without any agreed national budget, stalled between the Hill and the Oval Office. Another symbolic failure: the 106th Congress of the United States   has done little but squabble (and line its own pork barrels). These are not accidental impotencies. The balances on Capitol Hill are desperately close: five victories will give the Democrats the Senate, seven the House. Nobody knows how that will look on Wednesday morning - three donkeys ringing on the slot machine or three elephants, but just as likely another division of power. What can be guaranteed, though, is that the focus will immediately switch to 2002 and the next round in the struggle for control.  More cash to be raised, more rubber chickens, more wheeler-dealing and long days on the stump. There is never (as Clinton discovered in 1994, when the Congress swung against him) time to govern; there is only the need to keep running.  Gore acknowledges that explicitly in his 'fighting' rhetoric and implicitly in interminable photo opportunities, sprinting between speeches, dragging a puffing Joe Lieberman in his wake. Winning the presidency is not the end, but the beginning of new races.  Back to the great dislocation. Bush and Gore are being judged - by public opinion and the press - not for what they are, but what they are not. They are not Clinton, with his silky skills, his easy tongue, his undoubted brilliance at running to extricate himself from the last fine mess.  Gore oozes facts and policies, yet he can't sell them like Bill. George W. relies on jokes to get him through, but he doesn't tell them as well as Bill. Both of them know that, in office, they would soon have to go crawling after compromise on the Hill: Gore pleading with the warrior Republicans, Bush in all probability needing the Democrats to keep him grounded in independent America where the next batch of votes will come from.  Does Tuesday matter? Hugely, in many ways. The President is top dog in foreign policy and rigging the Supreme Court. His choice, for Americans, defines who they are and where they find their own centre of gravity. He will, whoever he is, set an agenda   on health, education, social security, that tips some of the balances.  But that is also all of a piece with the Murdoch ratings debacle. These are men of the centre ground trying to disguise it, wriggling back and forth and pretending to be something else: the Vice-President who doesn't campaign as well as his master and the Governor whose day job is mostly ceremonial. They field their wives and families like Windsors facing one kind of election and trade trillion-dollar plans like central bankers proving their gravitas. Why should the missing millions be so fascinated by that when Martin Sheen in  West Wing does the charade so much better?  Predictions are a mug's game. Bush is strong, but weaker in the states that count. Gore is weak, but beginning to erode the preening self-regard, the essential flippancy of the Nader campaign. America can't make up its mind: and that, I think, is because America knows in its heart of hearts that this is just another choice along the way, the choice before the next one.<B> THE GORE TEAM</B>   Democrat party spending    <B> $100m</B>     <B> JOE LIEBERMAN  </B><B> Vice President</B>   Considered the 'conscience' of Senate and Democrat party; Orthodox Jew, moral voice and seasoned moderate; good cop and bad cop all in one.   <B> BILL DALEY </B> <b> Chief of Staff</B>   Tough nut from the 'other' Democrat dynasty in Chicago, brought in to rescue and direct campaign.
