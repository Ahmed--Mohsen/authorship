Someone, day after day, is killing the children. We see them die, amid blood and grief. Yet in part, as we watch, we are killing them, too. That is the damnable thing about Ramallah and Nablus and Gaza. Consider our children, the children of Britain. They come wrapped, by public consent, in special status: they are minors, kids who aren't responsible and thus the ultimate responsibility of society itself. When their parents abuse or neglect them, they are taken away to a place of protection. The law adopts exceptional measures to hide their identities if they are involved - directly or indirectly - in crime. Schoolteachers can't raise a hand to them on pain of dismissal. Children come first.  Press and television, in their own codes of conduct, echo that concern. No identification under the age of 18; no photographs or interviews without parental approval; no invasions of privacy. And not just for Euan Blair or Prince Harry Windsor. If children perish, as they perished at Dunblane, we do not want to see the bodies in the playground nor the parents, engulfed in emotion, talking unwillingly to a prying camera. These children are our children; and their tragedy is our tragedy. Children, in the purest sense, are innocents. Children come first.  But on the West Bank or Gaza, children come first in a different way. They are the first to die - from the   12-year-old who died in his father's arms almost three weeks ago to 13-year-old Mohammed al-Najjar, shot in the head this weekend. Try to compute the victims of this latest uprising, this supposed war, and most of the 130 or so dead already are Palestinians - and, overwhelmingly, most of them are kids, teenage lads well short of their legal majority.  Thus mothers sob and fathers choke before our eyes. Schoolteachers talk sadly about empty desks. Women pallbearers at the endless funerals chant that "Israeli peace means killing the children". Mourning crowds take up the refrain to these teenage "martyrs". "Oh Arabs, pay attention - the Palestinians are getting killed."  And here is the damnable thing. None of this is an accident, a happenstance, a contrivance of fate. The children are first in the firing line by design. They have become cannon and media fodder.  Dr Stephen Males, a former assistant chief constable with a commission from Amnesty International, reported directly the other day on the course of the carnage. "The key point is that Israel is using military tactics and not establishing policing practices." This means that the army - and, yes, thousands of young conscripts - is bent on winning a conflict of retribution and domination the way armies do. "They are simply trying to wipe out or dominate the enemy" - while police officers, who know all about crowd control, stand idly by.   An appalling verdict, compendiously documented. Israel indicted. And the charge is not just sickening brutality, but imbecile strategy as well. For this, if it is war at all, has turned into a war for hearts and minds. "One side waits for violence; the other side obligingly shoots them."  The Palestinians, in turn, actively invite casualties. There's a "ritual pattern" to their demonstrations. Their police are not on hand to protect life or defuse tension. "They make no attempt to stop children and youngsters let out of school for the day from running alongside," Males told Michael Binyon of the Times. "There is a cynical allowance of the enormous risk to their lives."   Why, you ask, such callous cynicism? Oh Arabs, pay attention. The Palestinians can't "defeat" the Israelis (if such a concept has any meaning) by throwing sticks or stones. They have no army worth the name. They cannot wage conventional warfare. What they can do, and are doing, is foment world repugnance. Sit down, in your comfortable western homes: turn on CNN or ITN or the BBC or any of the   swelling range of cable channels - and be sickened.  More specifically, fill the cable and satellite TV channels of the Middle East - like MBC or ANN - with this everlasting horror, and the leaders of Damascus or Cairo or Riyadh will feel the heat. The boys on their streets see the pictures; they know which side they are on. Can they exert pressure for actual war on their fragile regimes? Will they, in turn, become the radicalised standard bearers of upheaval?  We've lost touch in Britain with the march of cable news, which still attracts only fragments of audience here. It isn't like that in the third world of ferment. When I was in Pakistan this year I found a satellite dish in every flyblown village. It cost two or three pounds a month, shared among the villagers, and it was their window on the world, reaching more than 50% of the entire population. Through that window, now, they will be seeing Jews kill Arab children round the clock, white-faced western reporters, rivers of blood flowing far into the future.  There is, if we are honest, a terrible - and new - dilemma here for journalists, and for those who buy their wares. We're hot on our dignity about spin doctoring. We quiver with rage whenever Mr Campbell peddles his tales. But what is this, on a more awful stage, than the work of the spinners of despair?  The parents of the West Bank could guard their children. The schools could stay   open. The police could control the demonstrations and the age of the demonstrators. Yasser Arafat and Marwan Barghouti, the leader on the streets, could unite to keep the kids away. No more 12 or 13-year-old "martyrs". But none of that happens. The spectacle - the spectacle we watch and, in the watching, in the viewing figures, perpetuate - continues.  As miserably usual with moral dilemmas, there is no pat solution. Shutting out the cameras and the reporters (as the Israelis would like) isn't an answer: darkness didn't stop the bloodshed in the first intifada, darkness cloaks a multitude of other sins. The sense of a watching world - from Belgrade to Maputo - is a powerful force for good. It may even, here, drive Jerusalem to see what havoc it is making for itself.  But if we're going to choose truth above silence, then let it be the truth. And the truth here is not merely that the young men of Israel are shooting the young boys of Palestine, but that we, the reporters on the spot, the cameras, the editors at home and you in your living rooms, are a vital factors in this vile equation.  If we understand that, we begin to understand what's going on, and to be able to make judgments of our own as instinctively as we would make them for our own children, the special kids who come first. Without that, there is only one damnable thing after another.  <A <B>Useful links</B><BR>  <A HREF="http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html">Madeleine Albright's office</A>  <BR><A HREF="http://www.p-p-o.com">Yasser Arafat's office</A>  <BR><A HREF="http://www.pmo.gov.il/english">Ehud Barak's office</A>  <BR><A HREF="http://www.index.gov.il/eng">Israeli government</A>  <BR><A <BR>  <A HREF="http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm" TARGET="_new">Moledet  - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)<BR>  <A HREF="http://www.iris.org.il/" TARGET="_new">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</A><BR>  <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/" TARGET="_new">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm" TARGET="_new">Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.pna.org">Palestinian National Authority</A>  <BR><A HREF="http://www.presidency.gov.eg" TARGET="_new">Egyptian presidency</A>  <BR><A HREF="http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm" TARGET="_new">Hamas</A>
