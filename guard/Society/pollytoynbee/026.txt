Downing Street has sent out messengers to all ministers high and low to gather ideas for the coming manifesto. Clever policy wheezes are no doubt desired, but the big questions are also being asked. What are we for? Where next? It is a genuine seeking of answers. The brave will reply from the heart, risking implied criticism of what has gone before. Others may reflect back what they think is wanted in the hope of advancement. Some will advocate radicalism: others will say steady-as-she-goes.  Bumping into one manifesto writer, the comment was: "The manifesto? Look, we don't even know what the spin is yet, let alone what's in it." Oh, the cynicism, you might think! But that's not it. He meant something more serious. In a manifesto the medium - the spin - is the message that makes sense of inchoate substance.   Labour has yet to decide if it wants to be (and be seen as) a radical progressive reforming force or prefers to be a decent, safe pair of hands. The balanced "big tent" beckons, with something to please everyone - a little tax cutting and law and order running alongside better public services and a bit more pulling up the poor by their bootstraps: con- sensus government for a non-ideological age. Other ministers want a fight to the death with the forces of conservatism.   This manifesto will finally define whether the first term was a solid platform from which to mount a great leap forwards or just a small slope up which to trudge on slowly. While some want a noisy ideological fight, others urge a manifesto that does not wear its heart on its sleeve. Why risk frightening the horses? A modest manifesto leaves all options open, not foreclosing on radicalism but giving no hostages to fortune.   There are good electoral reasons why Labour needs to stand and fight this time, no hedging. It needs firmer friends. The only danger at the election is a Labour vote sitting sourly on its hands at home. Labour and its leader have no core fan club, the way Mrs Thatcher did even in her darkest hours. To be loved in politics it is necessary to dare to be hated too. That "Forces of Conservatism" speech briefly recognised this - but then Mr Blair retreated, uncertain.   This election presents a God-given enemy. Who better than William Hague - extreme and opportunist embodiment of everything Mr Blair believes himself and his party not to be. If ever there was a chance for Labour to define itself with clarity, it is in the clear red water it can put between the parties this time. Last time Labour did not know how far it could dare to be itself. This time dissembling would be a serious tactical error.   Mr Hague hopes tax cuts can do for him what those trillion-dollar promises did for George W Bush. Which way Labour jumps on this in the pre-election budget will tell us all we need to know - an acid test of values. Gordon Brown can offer another cheeky little income tax cut (maybe slanted towards the bottom end, as Al Gore uselessly proposed) to show Labour can tax-cut too. Or Labour can stand and fight on the principle that taxation is not bad but a public good. Read Labour's lips, no more tax cuts - all available money will be spent on public services. Siren voices will tell Mr Blair that he can have both. Stronger voices should warn that this "having it all" has left him curiously friendless, with a damagingly blurred image.   What Labour needs is that elusive red thread, the story that tells us who they are, just as we knew who Mrs Thatcher was - strength through clarity of purpose.   Insiders are seeking a meta-narrative. Curiously the facts are there but the story is missing. Unemployment dropped like a stone, children's benefits rose by 70%, a quarter of children taken out of poverty, interests rates down by 4% (worth £1,000 a year to the average family), NHS spending up, primary schools better, crime down steeply. But it is meaningless until forged into a coherent message, such as: things people value most can only be bought collectively through good government. Money in the private pocket buys less, not more, than money spent in common.   They worry that "government is good" sounds triumphalist when there is still too much for this government to be modest about: a lot done, but a hell of a lot still to do. The manifesto, they say, must balance humility and ambition. With trains stopped dead in their tracks, a possible winter flu crisis ahead, urban comprehensives still fled by all who can, how do they talk up the virtue of bigger government with too few results yet? Since the Tories have kindly offered up less government and less tax as their big story, this will be the election battleground. Labour should relish a showdown between the American way and the European way. This time Thatcherism can finally be staked through the heart so that if the Tories ever limp back into contention, it will be on social democratic turf.   Many ministers now mulling over what advice to give do want the bigger splash in clear red water. No more pointless privatisations, totems of a bygone era. The new era is Labour's. Time to throw off Tory clothes and be themselves, true believers in good government. Now the manifesto has to sell the vision of what could be - beautiful cities, successful schools, gentler working conditions, the next decade's 30% increase in wealth used not as cash-in-hand but on a better quality of life.  </a>                                                  Feedback: What should the manifesto priorities be?
