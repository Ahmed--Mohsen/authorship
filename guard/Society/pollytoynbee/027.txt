That old monster "the liberal elite" is to blame for everything. For "the rising tide of crime", for Damilola Taylor and Sarah Payne's deaths, for Tony Martin's imprisonment, for the death of the family, single mothers, paedophiles and every other social evil under the Sun. "Political correctness" is to blame, the esperanto of liberalism.  William Hague may be intoxicated by the sight of George W Bush ascending the White House throne after ordering the frying of over 100 men and women on death row. If law and order won it for Dubya, maybe it can win it for William too. The phrase "liberal elite" is American, something that may exist on the East Coast, in the Ivy League or the New York Review of Books world, but has never wielded power this side of the Atlantic, or not since Asquith and the death of liberal England.   Who is this liberal elite? My own name is the only one to feature in Hague's speech to the Centre for Policy Studies yesterday - a great honour. But the truth is, if one columnist from the small sliver of the British press that is to the left of centre is the best he can find, it shows how pitifully thin on the ground liberals must be. It is quite difficult to be an elite of just one. This happens frequently with the anti-liberal rants in the Sun or far-right commentators: in all their fulminations about this shadowy but immensely powerful liberal entity they can never think of anyone within shouting distance of government to call liberal. New Labour never has been liberal. Hague only mentions Jack Straw's name once. Why? Because no one hearing his name thinks this government is run by a bunch of lily-livered limousine-liberals.   Out there in the 70% of the press that is not just to the right, but these days far right, there is a plethora of comment pouring out of the pens of the likes of Peter Hitchens, Bruce Anderson, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Peter Mackay, Janet Daley, Melanie Phillips, Paul Johnson, Richard Littlejohn, Peter Dobie - I could fill the page with this roll of honour. Their words infuse the air the country breathes, serving just three press magnates whose pernicious influence corrodes all political discourse.   Against these forces of conservatism the liberal voice is pathetically weak. The great majority of the population will rarely hear or read a liberal sentiment. That is why people believe crime is rising when it has fallen for six straight years right across the western   world. Stoking up fear of crime is these rightwing commentators' black art, a fear deliberately inflamed to tip the people rightwards.   The influence of this rightwing army spreads far wider than just the declining readership of newspapers. For all its claims of balance, inevitably the BBC's agenda uses these far-right fruitcakes as one marker, dragging the whole debate further over to the right than the general consensus. Take an issue like abortion: 85% consistently support it in opinion polls, yet the BBC always has an archaic anti-abortion voice in every embryo discussion, a Victoria Gillick in every contraception debate, simply because the threatening but unrepresentative noise of the rightwing press demands this as "balance". So too with most other issues. It is time the BBC recentred itself, ignoring the cacophony of the press. It may be gratifying to be named as the liberal threat and enemy but how absurd: the liberal end of the rope is always tugged far to the right by the press bullies.   As for Hague's speech, this is all desperate thrashing about by a failed leader of a failed party. Like a fish in a net, the more he thrashes, the more he is doomed. Since he took over the wreckage of the Conservative party he has made every navigational error, taken every wrong turn and has now beached it in the shallows on a desert island. His issue, Europe, is a dead duck now. Once the strongest genuine difference between the parties, firm ground on which to stand and fight, it turned to quicksand on Monday when Tony Blair returned from Nice with all his QMVs and weighted votes in place - no inch of flesh vulnerable to the Eurosceptics.   Every other issue has turned to dust in Hague's inept hand. His tax cut guarantee demolished, he is left pledging implied billions on everything he mentions yet each time he promises more nurses, police or teachers his tax cuts look the more implausible and undesirable. The more he describes the plight of public services, the more voters are reminded of the need for more public money.    His fantasy economics promised yesterday 10 more secure training centres for 1,000 young offenders. Each place costs £403 per day yet he refuses to commit to matching, let alone increasing law and order spending. All that is left for a man stagnant at one third in the polls, with only an aging cohort of supporters, is to rant.   The last refuge of desperate conservatism is always race. Hague's speech is racist in every sentiment, linking crime with colour, blaming Macpherson and fewer random stop and searches on black youths for street crime. Even those words sympathising with the honest black community's suffering as prime victims of crime only serves to fix the black/crime connection more firmly.   Forget the experimental baseball cap and coconut at the Notting Hill carnival - it will be black crime and asylum seekers from now on. If the election campaign begins this low, it will sink below anything ever seen in this country by election day.   Do race and extreme illiberalism on single parents, gays, abortion or sex education really pay political dividends? From the timbre of the British press an outsider might presume that the soul of the country resides within the black heart of Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail. Luckily it does not. (Only 14% of Mail readers ever voted Labour). The British Social Attitudes survey reveals a country far more progressive - at ease on all these issues, uncensorious about personal morality. In the world of Goodness Gracious Me and Lenny Henry, Britain, says the   Runnymede Trust, is the least racist country in Europe.   We liberals are closer to the majority. Hague is marooned in yesteryear with his shrinking blue-rinse party while we are swimming in the sea of pluralism, multiculturalism, complex families, difficult choices, all the muddle born of freedom. If we are the elite, that is because we are winning: British Social Attitudes shows people become more liberal the more educated they are. Conservatives have always been the stupid party. Graduates will soon be half the population, so Tories will be educated out of existence. To be liberal is to be free of superstition and irrational fear, open to the new, optimistic about the future, knowing there has never been a better time to be alive than now.  </a>                                                 Feedback: Proud to be a liberal?
