Worlds slip and slide, lamented T.S. Eliot, and never more so than in the mouths of Ministers and generals. If you can answer 20 or so of the following questions, you are a hopeless and miserable cynic. Ignorance may be bliss, but 10 or fewer correct answers suggests a dangerous gullibility.

"I'm glad I don't have a book coming out this month," I said - a selfish and trivial response to the disaster, but one I thought he would understand.
