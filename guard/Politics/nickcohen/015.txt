A friend of mine in the Lib Dems was stuck next to a partner from one of the accountancy conglomerates the other day. Wise voices were saying the best way to restore confidence in the financial markets was to regulate the profession that gave us Enron until the numbers crunch. So she asked if he was worried about Ministers imposing   independent statutory regulation and a ban on auditors selling lucrative consultancy work. He had no fears. The Government, he said, couldn't function without the accountancy cartel. It would grind to a halt.  An idle boast? Not a bit of it, as researchers for the Lib Dems and Unison have found. Don Foster, the Lib    Dem transport spokesman, asked departments how much public money the big accountancy firms had received since New Labour came to power. Not every penny they took is covered by his survey, but the results were: PricewaterhouseCoopers have had £83.6 million, Ernst &amp; Young £30.1m, Deloitte &amp; Touche £55m and KPMG   £55.9m. Before Andersen was destroyed by Enron and its other scandals, it had taken £72.9m.  Unison has looked at what the taxpayer got in return. PwC and Andersen produced reports saying that the Government's Private Finance Initiative was prudent. Neither mentioned a potential conflict of interest which might have disturbed wary minds. As advisers to the Government, the Big Five (as they were until Andersen was put in the dock) devised, audited and evaluated PFI schemes. Ken Livingstone is contemplating legal action against the part-privatisation of the London Underground because PwC, which evaluated the deal, and Ernst &amp; Young, which said   it was value for money, are auditors to five of the eight bidders for the contracts.  Then there are the staff from firms that tell clients how to dodge taxes seconded to work in Whitehall, including, incredibly, the Inland Revenue. You can see why accountants feel safe. How can the Government regulate them? They  are the Government.
