Britain is in the dock, the object of withering criticism from enemies and of rueful regret from     friends. An election has been postponed because of a disease that could and should have been     controlled better; the same was true of BSE. Last week's outbreak of tuberculosis at a school in     Leicester seems to underline the message - our systems for managing contagious and dangerous     diseases are not working.     The message that we can't manage anything is reinforced by the continuing disaster of our     transport system. Travel times in towns are slower than they were a century ago, while we cannot     agree how we should organise the London Underground or our national rail system.      But if the public sector seems irredeemably second rate, the news from the private sector is     hardly better. Marks & Spencer, struggling to restore its profitability, feels that it has to close its     entire overseas operations at a stroke. The Anglo-Saxon brutality of the way the news was broken     to its French work force has shocked France, whose more socially-inclusive approach to     workplace relations has not stopped it from becoming the most dynamic country in Europe. BT,     our flagship telecommunications company, is labouring under a debt of £30 billion. On top of it all,     we have suffered more rain than in any year since records began, a flood matched only by the     scale of commentary suggesting that the country is losing it.      Some of this is unfortunate conjuncture. The unravelling of the internet bubble which has caught     up BT is happening everywhere. And in an era where the media hunts as a pack, when it decides     on saturation coverage then a partial truth becomes the truth, if only for the duration of the     coverage. Last week's news that 750,000 more people have been discovered to be in work as a     result of a new survey occasioned negligible interest. It doesn't fit the story that Britain is second     rate.      The coverage has struck a deep chord at home and abroad because, sadly, it does reveal a truth -     the British have lost whatever talent they had for organisation. The collapse of ideological rivalry     and the birth of managerial politics has produced an overriding preoccupation with doing what     works and that, in turn, has exposed that we are not good at doing what works. Our management is     weak in both the public and private sectors. When the Football Association asked a Swede to     manage the English football team, the moment was pregnant with symbolism - we can't even     produce top football managers. Ken Livingstone has hired an American to run the London     Underground; Marks & Spencer looked to a Belgian to organise its turnaround; the Government     went for a Frenchmen to save the Dome.      It's not that we don't know that we are deficient in management skills. Talk to any Blairite for more     than 30 seconds and he'll shake his head at the incompetence of the civil service; the second     term, he says, must be about a new emphasis on better management. The plethora of     Treasury-inspired performance targets has been an attempt to change the culture of the civil     service, but with scant reward so far. The Treasury has gone one step further and set up a     standing committee to find outwhat the Government can do to improve British management   This is the background against which the management-consultancy industry has boomed. Britain now has more than 100 institutions offering degree courses in management. If you want to change     your organisation and improve its management, you can do anything from borrowing from     Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson's toolkit of motivational skills to sending your     executives on an outward-bound course.      But most of it is little more than faddish quackery, remote from the question of how you eradicate     foot and mouth, organise a rail system or keep your shops up to the mark. Management theory and     the management consultants suffer from the same failings as the organisations they purport to     advise. They want quick-fix solutions and instant results, moving on from one fad to another in an     effort to find the Holy Grail and, as importantly, have something fresh to sell to credulous company     boards. Ten years ago, the message was to build synergies by constructing organisations with lots     of overlapping competences. Today, the message is to downsize to an organisation's core,     contract out and do as little as possible yourself. This is the kind of management theory that     validates the way Railtrack was privatised or the structure of the PPP for the Underground.      The truth is that there are no quick-fix solutions and that privatisation or contracting out solves     nothing if the management of the contractee is as poor as the contractor. Organisations that work,     like the British Army, the Swiss rail system or any German manufacturer, have a powerful culture     and ethos that has been built up over time. Their members know what is expected of them, know     that the organisation will reward them for doing it well and are proud of what it stands for.Modernisation is inbuilt into the organisation's fabric because everybody has a stake in the future.Britain's problem is simply stated - with one or two exceptions, we don't provide the context in     which our organisations can be led even to reach this point. Our Ministers are not leaders of     departments of state; they are not in place for long enough for that, nor do they define their role in     those terms. Permanent secretaries are little more than nineteenth-century nabobs, so that a     ministry like Maff is not led or managed around clear, long-term objectives, so, by default, its     purpose remains the same as in 1940 - maximising domestic food production by whatever means     and at whatever risk.        In the private sector, leadership falls to the priorities of the stock market, which permits no     long-term strategic view. Marks & Spencer's problems are that it spent a decade trying to deliver     the expectations of the stock market and ended up woefully unprepared to meet the expectations     of the market that really mattered - its customers.Trying to sort itself out in 12 months, as the     market wants, means it must do what it is doing - cannibalising itself.The media caravan will move on and the criticism die down, but the truth remains - to be other     than second rate, we must be better organised, a proposition as distant as trains that run on time.
